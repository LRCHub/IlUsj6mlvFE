[00:02.65] Ooh, you feel that
[00:05.84] As I take you to them dirt roads, deep down in your southern roots
[00:10.10] Where nobody said life was gon' be easy
[00:12.76] And we travel through this emotional roller coaster called life
[00:16.07] And we have our ups and downs
[00:17.41] Just keep in mind, when you hit rock bottom
[00:18.88] There ain't nowhere to go but up, baby
[00:21.25] Just all about how you deal with it, ya feel me
[00:24.01] Listen here
[00:25.83] When life seems hopeless
[00:27.91] It make a nigga lose focus
[00:29.87] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[00:32.09] Helps to get it off my chest
[00:34.09] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[00:35.69] And all I hear is fuck the world
[00:38.12] When life seems hopeless
[00:40.33] It make a nigga lose focus
[00:42.08] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[00:44.75] Helps to get it off my chest
[00:46.54] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[00:48.30] And all I hear is fuck the world
[00:50.49] Man, ever since life's been a gamble, my life's been in shambles
[00:53.72] Double-edge swords burning both sides of the candle
[00:56.98] But Chris, you can't handle the truth
[00:59.15] Don't wanna face reality
[01:00.82] So lower than accept my apology
[01:03.71] Please, like when police say freeze
[01:06.32] And I ain't do shit but I'm down on my knees
[01:09.19] It's a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away
[01:12.27] I charge the game and put my problems on layaway
[01:15.45] A black man but I feel so blue
[01:18.24] So I smoke green and purple 'til my dreams come true
[01:20.91] And my eyes turn red, the sky turns gray
[01:24.05] Children slangin' white in the hood, we call it yay
[01:27.10] Drinkin' Ol' Gold down my yellow brick road
[01:30.48] Then we write my script until my story's untold
[01:33.26] See, I got a little money and my life's sped up
[01:36.18] Now I'm fallen and I can't get up
[01:38.94] When life seems hopeless
[01:41.38] It make a nigga lose focus
[01:43.12] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[01:45.85] Helps to get it off my chest
[01:47.56] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[01:48.91] And all I hear is fuck the world
[01:51.55] When life seems hopeless
[01:53.45] It make a nigga lose focus
[01:55.33] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[01:58.38] Helps to get it off my chest
[02:00.04] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[02:01.59] And all I hear is fuck the world
[02:03.82] I had a dream about a dope fiend
[02:05.84] And it's strange 'cause he get a Bentley right away
[02:08.68] Seem to get just for 'bout anything
[02:11.16] Pure survival, I want to talk with him
[02:13.33] He said he was too busy for that
[02:15.03] But I was more than willing the walk with him
[02:17.28] So as we walked, he talked and I just listened
[02:19.66] He said, â€½There's a big difference between crackers and niggazâ€
[02:22.95] And he said, â€½White folks look out for the white folksâ€
[02:25.67] But uhh, black folks blame other black folks
[02:28.02] When there ain't enough black folks
[02:29.12] But yo, to make a long story short
[02:31.62] We need to pay more attention
[02:33.24] And do things that's way more convincing
[02:34.97] And he told me you know
[02:36.02] I wouldn't say something
[02:37.52] What's working or not
[02:38.53] Damn sure, wouldn't waste my time
[02:40.01] Tellin' you something that'll hurt you
[02:41.07] It's your fault for anything, if you done
[02:42.72] Stand for something that's for certain
[02:44.03] But niggaz don't be listenin' and that shit be hurtin'
[02:46.73] Not all of us but some of us
[02:49.18] And if we don't hurry up
[02:50.35] They gon bury each and every life of us
[02:52.89] When life seems hopeless
[02:54.14] It make a nigga lose focus
[02:55.79] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[02:58.27] Helps to get it off my chest
[03:00.28] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[03:01.88] And all I hear is fuck the world
[03:04.20] When life seems hopeless
[03:06.23] It make a nigga lose focus
[03:08.27] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[03:10.06] Helps to get it off my chest
[03:12.76] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[03:14.31] And all I hear is fuck the world
[03:16.64] Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues just being sober
[03:20.02] Life's a bitch and I can't control her
[03:22.67] I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
[03:26.21] The government stand us up to run us over
[03:28.25] And in the hood, they don't seem to understand, goddamn
[03:32.18] What's really got me wondering, if this part of the bigger plan?
[03:35.23] Man, I smell something fishy going on
[03:37.39] It's way beyond blowing away the smoke from all of swishas going on
[03:41.15] There ain't much that I can do about it, no
[03:43.06] But preach the word, tell my peoples spend your money wisely, yup
[03:46.61] Don't be absurd by somethings that are fishy, like what
[03:49.18] Like at home, wake up and open your eyes to what the fuck is going on
[03:53.47] 'Cause they constantly getting rid of us, yup
[03:55.79] One by one, whether it's drugs or diseases or it's gun by gun
[03:59.31] I ain't no saint either, I feel I'm even doing wrong
[04:02.30] By using what's in this chorus to get through this song
[04:05.22] When life seems hopeless
[04:06.69] It make a nigga lose focus
[04:08.66] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[04:11.32] Helps to get it off my chest
[04:13.23] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[04:14.75] And all I hear is fuck the world
[04:16.90] When life seems hopeless
[04:18.81] It make a nigga lose focus
[04:20.74] Empty beer bottles and roaches
[04:23.60] Helps to get it off my chest
[04:25.14] 'Cause I'm so stressed
[04:27.02] And all I hear is fuck the world
[04:29.07] You know, y'all gonna mess around and keep on complaining
[04:34.42] 'Bout slavery and umm, that was over 40-50 years ago, you know
[04:38.34] Black folks need to move on
[04:40.02] No stay strong and umm, y'all keep playing with us crackers
[04:44.53] They gonna have your ass somewhat tied up, wired up
[04:47.12] Of the back roads of South Florida, Georgia, you know
[04:50.84] And they made the law, so this shit can't do nothing for you
[04:53.38] Can a church get an Amen, God for the thugs too, Amen
