This is It
Yeah
Waoaoo

Said I've paid my dues for all that i've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
Freedom to us has always been a trick
Freedom to u has always been who ever landed on your dick
Seen it in you one too many times
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice no

Might trick me once

Those days are old and overdone
And it's only cause i'm not with you that you make me number one
Though I may love you, It hurts me deep inside Yeah
Now you no longer have to hide

I used to be down with the late night hit
Started gettin' heavy when I really wasn't ready
Used my past to get my mind
So I fell for your lies like all the time
I thought you were the shit to be playin around
Call the police theres a mad girl in town
Could'nt get even here without a sound
It's not how I wanna get down Yeah (You)

Might trick me once

Might trick me once

No I won't let you trick me twice

Well I've paid my dues for all that i've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
Theres nothing left there to decide
Uh, Trick me, I won't let you trick me twice
You might trick me once, I won't let me trick you twice
