(Woah-oh-oh)
This is It
Yeah
(Woah-oh-oh)
Said I've paid all my dues for what I've done
And I showed you that I love you more than once
Theres nothing left there to deside
Said you might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
Freedom to us has alwayz been a trick
Freedom to u has alwayz been who ever landed on your dick
Seen it in your one to many times
Said you might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice no
Might trick me once (woah-oh-oh)

Those days are old and overdone
And it's only cause I'm not with you that makes me number one
Though I may love you
I hurts me deep inside oh
Now you no longer have to hide
I used to be down with the late night hit (woah-oh-oh)
Started gettin' heavy when I really wasn't ready (woah-oh-oh)
Used my class to get in my mind (woah-oh-oh)
So I fell for your lies like all the time (woah-oh-oh)
I thought you were the shit to be playin around (woah-oh-oh)
Call the police there's a mad girl in town (woah-oh-oh)
Couldn't get even here without a sound (woah-oh-oh)

Might trick me once (woah-oh-oh)
I won't let you trick me twice (woah-oh-oh)
No, I won't let you trick me twice
No, I won't let you trick me twice
Well, I paid all my dues for all that I've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
